# Prime-Detector
A multi-threaded prime number detector that takes an input file of numbers and a user specified number of threads, printing any prime numbers found. Processes input numbers from a mutex-protected queue and parallelizes individual sub-calculations for each number. Use of thread pool allows for thread reuse, and thread cancellation considerably speeds processing time for very large numbers.
